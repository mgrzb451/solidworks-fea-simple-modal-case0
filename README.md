# Plastic Case base Modal analysis
Very 1st foray into Modal Analysis with simple Frequency analysis in Solidworks.
I modeled a very basic case made of PBT in 3 different version to see how adding different types of stiffening ribs would impact the Natural Frequencies.
This project is done just to go through the steps of performing the analysis and seeing what comes up. I will start learning the actual theory behind Finite Element Analysis once I'm done with my current theoretical learning project üòÅ
